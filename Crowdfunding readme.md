# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze data from several Kickstarter campaigns, specifically launch dates for theaters and fundraising goals for theatrical plays. The customer, Louise, asked for assistance in determining how different kickstarter campaigns compare in relation to fundraising goals and launch dates.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
There were a total of 1369 theater kickstarter campaigns represented in the dataset. The outcomes of the campaigns were classified as successful, failed, or canceled. By sorting the outcomes by month, the line chart clearly shows the launch months that had successful campaigns. ![This is the line chart](https://github.com/jcourt99/Kickstarter-Analysis/blob/main/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
One conclusion drawn from the dataset is that the launch months of May and June are the best months to launch a theater campaign. The second conclusion drawn is that December is the worst month to launch a campaign.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
