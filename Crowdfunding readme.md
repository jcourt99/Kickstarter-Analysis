# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze data from several Kickstarter campaigns, specifically launch dates for theaters and fundraising goals for theatrical plays. The customer, Louise, asked for assistance in determining how different kickstarter campaigns compare in relation to fundraising goals and launch dates.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
There were a total of 1369 theater kickstarter campaigns represented in the dataset. The outcomes of the campaigns were classified as successful, failed, or canceled. By sorting the outcomes by month, the line chart clearly shows the launch months that had successful campaigns. ![This is the line chart](https://github.com/jcourt99/Kickstarter-Analysis/blob/main/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
This analysis looked at 1047 theatrical plays in the kickstarter campaign dataset. The analysis compares the dollar amounts of the goals set for each campaign and the success rate of those campaigns. The line chart shows the correlation between the goal amount and the campaign's successfullness. ![This is the line chart](https://github.com/jcourt99/Kickstarter-Analysis/blob/main/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png)

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I did not face any challenges with this project. However, it was time-consuming to change the dollar amounts for each COUNTIF cell of the "Outcomes Based On Goals" worksheet. 


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
One conclusion drawn from the dataset is that the launch months of May and June are the best months to launch a theater campaign. The second conclusion drawn is that December is the worst month to launch a campaign.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
One definitive conclusion based on the data provided is the failure of theatrical plays with a goal of $45,000 or more. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
This dataset does not show the efforts or methods of each campaign's fundraisers. Perhaps some campaigns reached thousands of potential investors, while other campaigns only reached a few investors.


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
It would be helpful to compare the number of backers with the pledged amount and success rate for each campaign. This would show the popularity of the campaign or how hard the fundraisers worked for the campaign.
